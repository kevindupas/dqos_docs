To begin using the application, you'll need to log in with your credentials provided by the administrator.

If you're having trouble accessing your account, don't worry — a password reset option is available directly from the login page.

## Login

To access the application, you must enter your email address and the password provided by the application administrator.

If you check the **“Remember me”** box, your session will remain active indefinitely. Otherwise, you will be automatically logged out after 2 hours.
