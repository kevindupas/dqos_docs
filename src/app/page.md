## Scoring & Ranking

The DQoS system includes advanced **scoring** and **ranking** features that combine network KPIs with topological data to provide meaningful insights into network performance.

### Scoring

The **Scoring** page allows you to:

- Calculate scores by region, province, etc.
- Filter by operator, network type (2G, 3G, 4G...), and date.
- Visualize voice and data quality scores for each operator.

This enables precise, data-driven analysis of service delivery across geographical areas.

### Ranking

The **Ranking** page displays:

- Operator rankings per region or province, updated daily.
- A list of regions sorted from best to worst based on performance.
- Access to detailed data over the past 7 days by clicking on a specific region.

These tools help regulators and stakeholders monitor operator performance and take corrective actions when needed.
