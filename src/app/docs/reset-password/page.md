## Check your inbox

You’ll receive an email from **DQoS Zimbabwe** titled **“Reset Password Notification”**.  
Click the **“Reset Password”** button in the email to proceed.

If the button doesn’t work, use the fallback link at the bottom of the email.

Don’t forget to check your spam or junk folder if you don’t see the message.
